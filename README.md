# Sql-Commands
## These are the sql commands I wrote when I learned Oracle SQL while I was a trainee at DSA.
 ### These Commands was ordered 4 group:
 #### 1. Ä°ntroduction to Sql (Get data from Table, Filtering Data)
 #### 2. Sql Basic Functions (Aggregate Functions, Group by & Having Clause)
 #### 3. Joins & Set Operators
 #### 4. Constraints, DDL Operations & DML Statements with Subquery, Analytics Functions
### The folders belong to one of each group. There are 2 txt files, one of the txt files is Questions, the other txt file is combining Questions and Answers in itself. Each group has 2 sections. The first part is easy, the second part is more difficult than the first part.
#### Note: Each of the commands run in [LiveOracleSql](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/f?p=590:1:103462609988166:::RP). You must be have an account in [LiveOracleSql](https://profile.oracle.com/myprofile/account/create-account.jspx) for to runs commands. Don`t worry, this is easy. You need just mail.
