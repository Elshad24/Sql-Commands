# Sql-Commands
## These are the sql commands I wrote when I learned Oracle SQL while I was a trainee at DSA.
 ### These Commands was ordered 4 group:
 #### 1. İntroduction to Sql (Get data from Table, Filtering Data)
 #### 2. Sql Basic Functions (Aggregate Functions, Group by & Having Clause)
 #### 3. Joins & Set Operators
 #### 4. Constraints, DDL Operations & DML Statements with Subquery, Analytics Functions
## Each groups has 2 part. First part is easy, second part is hard than first part.
